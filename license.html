<p>iHostNZ provides the computer software, documentation, and source code in this product ('Licensed Software') and licenses its use to the party ("You") who purchases and uses this product, as follows:</p>

<p>BINARY LICENSE. You have the non-transferable right to use one (1) copy, on one (1) single computer system or network, with the number of seats specified on the original invoice, of Licensed Software internally for Your own research and development or other business purposes.  You must purchase a license for each developer that will be using the Licensed Software.  Licenses are non-<wbr>transferable.</p>

<p>You may make one machine readable copy of the Licensed Software for backup purposes. You may not otherwise copy the Licensed Software or any of its documentation in printed form. You must, as a condition of Your license under this Agreement, reproduce and include all copyright and other proprietary notices on the backup copy.</p>

<p>You may not transfer possession of Licensed Software, whether in part or in whole, to other parties.  You may not copy enclosed documentation or distribute them to other parties. You may not modify Licensed Software or disassemble it for the purpose of obtaining the source code.  You agree not to "reverse engineer" the Licensed Software or any portion of it or to permit such reverse engineering or otherwise reduce the Software to a human-perceivable form.</p>

<p>SHAREWARE LICENSE.  If this software has been provided to You as "shareware", then this license is restricted as follows:  You may use this software only to the extent necessary to determine whether it is fit for Your needs.  This evaluation period is limited to 30 days after your initial receipt of the software.  If you decide to continue using the software beyond this period, you must purchase the number of licenses as required under the terms of the BINARY LICENSE.</p>

<p>RUN-TIME LIBRARY LICENSE.  The licensed material covered by this agreement may include a set of designated modules (the "Run-Time Library"), all or a portion of which may be linked with modules produced from your own sources to become an integral part of an executable program.  You may use and market such executable programs without the payment of any additional license fees, provided that you indemnify and hold iHostNZ and its suppliers harmless from any and all claims arising out of the sale, license, or any other use of such programs.  Any failure to provide this indemnity voids your license to use or redistribute the Run-Time Library.  You may not modify, network, rent, lend, loan, distribute or create derivative works or additional Run-Time Libraries that will give end users of the derivative product programmatic access to the same or similar features as the original Run-Time Libraries.</p>

<p>RESTRICTIONS ON DISCLOSURE.  You agree to use reasonable efforts, and to take the same precautions that You take to protect your own computer programs and other information of similar value that You do not wish to have disclosed or disseminated to others, to avoid disclosure or dissemination of any part of the Licensed Software, its documentation, or its source, to any third party by You and Your employees, agents or consultants (if any). These restrictions will not apply to any information that becomes publicly known, through no fault or breach on Your part, that iHostNZ regularly provides third parties without restrictions on disclosure or that you receive from a third party rightfully and without restriction on disclosure.</p>

In no event shall iHostNZ's total liability to you for all damages, losses, and causes of action (whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise) exceed the amount paid by you for the Software.</p>
