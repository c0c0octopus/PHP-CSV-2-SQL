The capacitive discharge produces multiple sparks up to 3500rpm and long duration spark higher ensure complete combustion of the air/fuel mixture to increase power and performance. The soft touch rev limiter will protect your engine from overrevving. Adjustments are easily made with plug-in modules, at your selected rpm, the limiter drops the spark to some of the cylinders, and on the next revolution, those cylinders are fired to prevent fuel fouling. The result is a smooth and accurate rev limiting without backfires.
The Soft Touch Rev Control allows you to add rpm accessories like a two step rev controll

"MSD6462","IGN AMP MSD 6BTM BOOST TIMING MASTER","IGNITION",763.54,"Y","Maximum power, no detonation risk.
The MSD 6-BTM ignitions are ideal for engines with a turbo or supercharger. Not only will they benefit from multiple sparks, but there is also an adjustable boost/timing retard to prevent detonation. The dash-mounted control knob lets you easily adjust the amount of timing retard from 0-3 degrees per pound of boost. Dial away engine-damaging detonation by retarding the timing in relation to boost pressure, and run on the threshold of detonation for maximum power and efficiency. You also get overrev protection from the soft touch rev control. 
For use on 4, 6 (even fire only), and 8-cylinder engines using a distributor. 
Rubber shock mounts included.
3,000, 6,000, 7,000, and 8,000 rpm plug-in rev limit modules included.

Multi keyways are solid fixture and do not tend to move or work lose like offset dowles, thus providing a positive locking of the cam timing to what ever posirtion is desired. 
No additional maching is required to fit these sets or the need for offset bushings or drilling of cam gears.

Rear water outlets allow custom cooling system routing. The flange above the intake ports is machined flat to provide a straight-line reference for port-matching layout. A boss for a distributor clamp has been added on the left side, for easier to access when timing an engine. Each runner has a nitrous boss to aid in fogger nozzle installation.

These sets come with a 9 keyway crankshaft sprocket in 2 degree increments, the relationship from crank keyway to camshaft sprocket timing is 2:1 meaning that the amount of advance or retard at the camshaft is in one degree increments. Multi keyways are solid fixture and do not tend to move or work lose like offset dowles, thus providing a positive locking of the cam timing to what ever posirtion is desired. 
No additional maching is required to fit these sets or the need for offset bushings or drilling of cam gears. 
All Red Label timing sets come with Rollmasters own premium grade full roller timing chain. Every small and big block Chev set comes standard with a brass thrust washer and is available with an optional one piece Torrington thrust bearing (ROCS1040)."

The balanced frictional characteristics provide smooth and consistent shifts for extended drain intervals. Racing ATF contains no slipperiness additives, producing faster shifts and quicker lockup, and can reduce elapsed time in drag racing. Their superior stability compared to petroleum ATFs allows high-temperature operation without varnishing valves and clutches, which can lead to transmission failure.

These sets come with a Torrington bearing and a 9 keyway crankshaft sprocket in 2 degree increments, the relationship from crank keyway to camshaft sprocket timing is 2:1 meaning that the amount of advance or retard at the camshaft is in one degree increments. Multi keyways are solid fixture and do not tend to move or work lose like offset dowles, thus providing a positive locking of the cam timing to what ever posirtion is desired. 
No additional maching is required to fit these sets or the need for offset bushings or drilling of cam gears. 
All Red Label timing sets come with Rollmasters own premium grade full roller timing chain. Every small and big block Chev set comes standard with a brass thrust washer."

They feature non-twist forging, go through a multi-stage heat-treatment process, and are stress-relieved and shot-peened. These cranks are X-rayed, magnafluxed, and sonic tested, so you know you're getting a top-quality piece. Each crankshaft has cross-drilled and chamfered oil holes for improved oiling, a .125 in. radius on rod and main journals for increased strength, and the journals are precision-ground and micro-polished to less than 5 RA. A target bobweight of +/- 2 percent greatly reduces balancing time.
